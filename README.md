# NightSky-cuHackathon

Night Sky:

simple use of the echoAR manager and a little bit of object creation to make a midnight sky.
Use the link: https://go.echoar.xyz/BFQy to get to the model. On your phone you will be able to
use the AR functionality, and if you view the link on your computer then you'll just see the 
object that we created itself.

On your phone just walk into the 'viewing' pod and you can see the surround view of a
portion of the night sky. You'll have to resize the pod as neccesary to fit your room (pinch to zoom). 

The two images in the repo is an example of the outside of the 'pod' and then an example of the inside of the 'pod'.

Simple project, but we think the idea is nice.

Thanks for the hackathon, it was fun to actually hangout 
and talk with a bunch of people in the trade!
